👋 **Hi there, I'm HoangVanThu**. This repository help you to build games on mobile devices.
- Project is a sample gamebase for mobile game using **singleton design pattern**, you can get used to it very easily and build a complete game quickly. Besides, the utilities of the **custom packages** will help you a lot in searching, displaying and programming.
- However, I do not recommend using it for large game projects. Anyway it is a bad pattern, you can see or read about it everywhere on the internet.

## The Goals of the Project
- [x] `Coin System`: add animations when player coin increase.
- [x] `Gameplay`: simple gameplay with ui ingame, win and lose.
- [x] `Setting`: setting for the game.
- [x] `Shop`: shop to buy skins.
- [x] `Daily Reward`: daily reward feature.
- [x] `Lucky Spin`: daily spin feature.
- [x] `Debug`: simple debugging.
- [x] `Data Storage`: easy to save player data, also fast and secure.
- [x] `Custom Inspector`: adjust variables showed on inspector.
- [x] `Custom Hierachy`: hierachy now more features
- [x] `Find Reference`: find all reference of an asset
- [x] `Build Report`: report build
- [x] `Custom Tween`: like dotween but faster and customizable
- [x] `PlayerPref Editor`: to read data which saved by playerPref
- [x] `Debug Console`: advanced debugging
- [x] `Level Editor`: design levels 
- [ ] `Laputa Thirdparty`: window to install third party like firebase, ads
